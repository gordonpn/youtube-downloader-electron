## Motivation

This project started by my parents asking me how to download YouTube videos or music from YouTube.

The problem is that I didn't want to send my parents to a suspicious online tool filled with ads.

Then, I had the idea to have a try at developing a clean and straightforward UI as a desktop app for them to use.

## Getting started with development

* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the development server (Electron)

### To build and package

* Run `npm run dist`

For this step, you will need have NPM and the dependencies installed.
